Of Repute
=========

A simple REST API for an individual resume, by __Jacob Lee__.

Setup
-----

You should be able to take the entire project and drop it into any apache directory that can run PHP 5.3.13, has mod_rewrite active, and allows .htacces files.

There is an example install on my own domain at:
[www.cleer.net/of-repute](http://www.cleer.net/of-repute).

More Information
----------------

An explanation on how to use the API can be found when you navigate to the root of the API's install diretory.
